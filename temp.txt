ðŸš€ Excited to Share My Latest Project: Expense Tracker! ðŸ’°

Iâ€™m thrilled to announce that Iâ€™ve developed a Minimum Viable Product (MVP) for an Expense Tracker application using the MERN stack! This project has been a great learning experience and Iâ€™m continuously working to enhance its features.

ðŸ”§ Technologies Used:

Frontend: React.js with Tailwind CSS for sleek and responsive styling.
Backend: Express.js for server-side logic.
Database: MongoDB to efficiently manage and store data.
Security: Implemented bcrypt for password hashing and JWT for secure authentication.

ðŸ’¡ Current Features:

User Registration & Login: Secure user authentication and personalized user experience.
Add Expenses: Easily log your expenses with details such as amount, category, and date.
Edit Expenses: Modify any details of your logged expenses to keep your records accurate.
Delete Expenses: Remove any expenses that are no longer needed.
Expense List View: View all your expenses in an organized list for easy tracking.
This is just the beginning, and Iâ€™m excited about the possibilities for further development. Stay tuned for more updates!
